  abstract     = {Immune-mediated thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura is characterized by severe thrombocytopenia and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. It is primarily caused by immunoglobin G type autoantibodies against ADAMTS13, a plasma metalloprotease that cleaves von Willebrand factor. However, reliable markers predictive of patient outcomes are yet to be identified. Seventy-three unique patients with a confirmed diagnosis of immune-mediated thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura between April 2006 and December 2017 were enrolled from the Univeristy of Alabama at Birmingham Medical Center. Clinical information, laboratory values, and a panel of special biomarkers were collected and/or determined. The results demonstrated that the biomarkers associated with endothelial injury (e.g. von Willebrand factor antigen and collagen-binding activity), acute inflammation (e.g. human neutrophil peptides 1-3 and histone/deoxyribonucleic acid complexes), and activation of the complement alternative pathway (e.g. factors Bb and iC3b) were all significantly increased in patients with acute immune-mediated thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura compared to those in the healthy controls who did not have a hematological disease; moreover, failure to normalize platelet counts within 7 days or failure to markedly reduce serum lactate dehydrogenase by day 5, low total serum protein or albumin, and high serum troponin levels were also predictive of mortality; so were the prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time, high fibrinogen, and elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase, Bb, and sC5b-9 on admission. These results may help to stratify patients for more intensive management; the findings may also provide a framework for future multicenter studies to identify valuable prognostic markers for immune-mediated thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.},

  abstract     = {Many practitioners believe in the phenomenon of being labeled either a "black cloud" or "white cloud" while on-call. A "white-cloud" physician is usually defined as one who sees fewer cases while a "black-cloud" is one who often receives more cases. To evaluate these phenomena, a 35-month prospective study was designed to evaluate the number of times apheresis staff was involved with emergent apheresis procedures at a large institution in the off hours between 10 pm and 7 am, since this is the time period when significant resources have to be mobilized to perform the procedure. During the study period, 92 emergent procedures (or "black-cloud" events, 8.6%) occurred. The median time between two consecutive "black-cloud" events was 9 days (range: 1-45 days). We found that there is no statistically significant association between the occurrence of "black-cloud" events and attending physicians (P = .99), nurses who had 56 or more days on-call during the course of the study (P = .28), year (P = .85), day of the week (P = .099), month (P = .57), or season of the year (P = .47). Therefore, the findings from this prospective 35-month confirmation study did not support the common perception that physicians or nurses maybe either "black clouds" or "white clouds." It is important that this meaningful result be shared with apheresis practitioners given that the label of being a "black cloud" may have undesirable psychological implications to the physicians and nurses.},

  abstract     = {Percutaneous transcatheter closure of patent foramen ovale (PFO closure) plus antiplatelet therapy has been shown to reduce the risk of recurrent stroke compared with medical therapy alone in carefully selected patients after cryptogenic stroke presumed to be from paradoxical embolism. Our objective was to determine the cost-effectiveness of PFO closure after cryptogenic stroke compared with conservative medical management from a US healthcare payer perspective. A decision analytic Markov model estimated the 15-year cost and outcomes associated with the additional benefit of PFO closure compared with medical management alone. Model inputs were obtained from published literature, national databases, and a meta-analysis of 5 published randomized clinical trials on PFO closure. Health outcomes were measured in quality-adjusted life years (QALY). Cost-effectiveness used the incremental cost per QALY gained, whereas the net monetary benefit assumed a willingness to pay of $150 000/QALY. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses estimated the uncertainty of model results. At 15 years, PFO closure compared with medical therapy alone improved QALY by 0.33 at a cost saving of $3568, representing an incremental net monetary benefit of $52 761 (95% interval -$8284 to $158 910). When the meta-analysis hazard ratio for stroke was increased to the 95% interval's upper bound of 0.77, one-way sensitivity analyses suggested that PFO closure's cost-effectiveness was $458 558 per additional QALY. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis suggested cost-effectiveness in 90% of simulation runs. PFO closure for cryptogenic strokes in the right setting is cost-effective, producing benefit in QALYs gained and potential cost savings. However, patient selection remains vitally important as marginal declines in treatment effectiveness can dramatically affect cost-effectiveness.},

  abstract     = {The objective of this study was to describe and quantify the impact of caring for a child with Dravet syndrome (DS) on caregivers. We surveyed DS caregivers at a single institution with a large population of patient with DS. Survey domains included time spent/difficulty performing caregiving tasks (Oberst Caregiving Burden Scale, OCBS); caregiver health-related quality of life (EuroQoL 5D-5L, EQ-5D); and work/activity impairment (Work Productivity and Activity Impairment questionnaire, WPAI). Modified National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) questions were included to assess logistical challenges associated with coordinating medical care. Thirty-four primary caregivers responded, and 30/34 respondents completed the survey. From OCBS, providing transportation, personal care, and additional household tasks required the greatest caregiver time commitment; arranging for child care, communication, and managing behavioral problems presented the greatest difficulty. EuroQoL 5D-5L domains with the greatest impact on caregivers (0=none, 5=unable/extreme) were anxiety/depression (70% of respondents≥slight problems, 34%≥moderate) and discomfort/pain (57% of respondents≥slight problems, 23%≥moderate). The mean EQ-5D general health visual analogue scale (VAS) score (0=death; 100=perfect health) was 67 (range, 11-94). Respondents who scored <65 were two- to fourfold more likely to report ≥moderate time spent and difficulty managing child behavior problems and assisting with walking, suggesting that children with DS with high degrees of motor or neurodevelopmental problems have an especially high impact on caregiver health. On the WPAI, 26% of caregivers missed >1day of work in the previous week, with 43% reporting substantial impact (≥6, scale=1-10) on work productivity; 65% reported switching jobs, quitting jobs, or losing a job due to caregiving responsibilities. National Health Interview Survey responses indicated logistical burdens beyond the home; 50% of caregivers made ≥10 outpatient visits in the past year with their child with DS. Caring for patients with DS exerts physical, emotional, and time burdens on caregivers. Supportive services for DS families are identified to highlight an unmet need for DS treatments.},

  abstract     = {The objective of this study was to estimate the annual direct and indirect costs associated with Dravet Syndrome (DS). A survey was electronically administered to the caregivers of patients with DS treated at Children's Hospital Colorado. Survey domains included healthcare utilization of the patient with DS and DS caregiver work productivity and activity impairment. Patient healthcare utilization was measured using modified questions from the National Health Interview Survey; caregiver work productivity and activity impairment were measured using modified questions from the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment questionnaire. Direct costs were calculated by multiplying the caregiver-reported healthcare utilization rates by the mean unit cost for each healthcare utilization category. Indirect costs included lost productivity, income loss, and lost leisure time. The indirect costs were a function of caregiver-reported hours spent caregiving and an hourly unit cost. The survey was emailed to 60 DS caregivers, of which 34 (57% response rate) responded. Direct costs on average were $27,276 (95% interval: $15,757, $41,904) per patient with DS. Hospitalizations ($11,565 a year) and in-home medical care visits ($9894 a year) were substantial cost drivers. Additionally, caregivers reported extensive time spent providing care to an individual with DS. This caregiver time resulted in average annual indirect costs of $81,582 (95% interval: $57,253, $110,151), resulting in an average total annual financial burden of $106,378 (95% interval: $78,894, $137,906). Dravet Syndrome results in substantial healthcare utilization, financial burden, and time commitment. Establishing evidence on the financial burden of DS is essential to understanding the overall impact of DS, identifying potential areas for support needs, and assessing the impact of novel treatments as they become available. Based on the study findings, in-home visits, hospitalizations, and lost productivity and leisure time of caregivers are key domains for DS economic evaluations. Future research should extend these estimates to include the potential additional healthcare utilization of the DS caregiver.},

We performed a systematic search using electronic databases including PubMed, EMBASE, Tufts CEA registry, Cochrane, and NHSEED from January 2010 through December 2015. Key words included (1) cost-effectiveness, cost-utility, economic evaluation, health economics, or cost-benefit AND (2) asthma. All CEA studies evaluating 1 or more asthma medication were included. Authors assessed each CEA study with respect to asthma-specific NIH outcome recommendations including core (hospitalizations, emergency department visits, outpatient visits, medication, interventions costs), supplemental (visit categories and work/school absence), and emerging (academic/job-related) asthma outcomes. Besides outcomes of each CEA, issues that could prevent robust cross-study comparison were identified and thematically summarized. A total of 12 pre-NIH and 14 post-NIH recommendation CEAs were included. Eleven (91.7%) and 14 (100%) of the pre-/post-NIH studies included at least 1 core outcome, respectively. Of the 26 total studies, 7 (26.9%) included asthma-specific outpatient visit categories, 6 (23.1%) included asthma school or work absences, 5 (19.2%) included respiratory health care use, and none of the studies included emerging outcomes. Other issues that hamper cross-study comparison include lack of standardized cost data, time frames, quality-of-life measures, and incorporation of adherence. Although the use of NIH-recommended asthma core outcomes has improved, there is still room for improvement in using supplemental and emerging outcomes. To allow robust cross-study comparisons, future work should focus on further standardizing of data sources and methods.},

The PLASMIC score helps determine the pretest probability of ADAMTS13 deficiency. Due to inherent limitations of both tests, and potential adverse effects and cost of unnecessary treatments, we performed a cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) investigating the benefits of incorporating an in-hospital ADAMTS13 test and/or PLASMIC score into our clinical practice. A CEA model was created to compare four scenarios for patients with TMAs, utilizing either an in-house or a send-out ADAMTS13 assay with or without prior risk stratification using PLASMIC scoring. Model variables, including probabilities and costs, were gathered from the medical literature, except for the ADAMTS13 send-out and in-house tests, which were obtained from our institutional data. If only the cost is considered, in-house ADAMTS13 test for patients with intermediate- to high-risk PLASMIC score is the least expensive option ($4,732/patient). If effectiveness is assessed as measured by the number of averted deaths, send-out ADAMTS13 test is the most effective. Considering the cost/effectiveness ratio, the in-house ADAMTS13 test in patients with intermediate- to high-risk PLASMIC score is the best option, followed by the in-house ADAMTS13 test without the PLASMIC score. In patients with clinical presentations of TMAs, having an in-hospital ADAMTS13 test to promptly establish the diagnosis of TTP appears to be cost-effective. Utilizing the PLASMIC score further increases the cost-effectiveness of the in-house ADAMTS13 test. Our findings indicate the benefit of having a rapid and reliable in-house ADAMTS13 test, especially in the tertiary medical center.},

We created a model comparing the cost of cryo vs. FC from the transfusion service perspective. A patient with acquired bleeding requiring fibrinogen replacement could receive either 15-20 cryo units or 3-4 g FC, consistent with the guidelines from the European Task Force for Advanced Bleeding Care in Trauma. All model parameters were estimated from institutional experiences and the medical literature. Additionally, a survey of US Transfusion Medicine fellowship directors was conducted. After adjusting for 28% wastage and technologist salary, cryo cost is $414/5-unit pool. Depending on the dose, FC is more expensive by $976-$1303. To be competitive with cryo, FC cost must decrease by 44% or be shown to save 0·25-0·66 ICU days. Of the 30 survey replies, 96·7% of US centres do not use FC for acquired bleeding with the top three reasons being cost (30%), off-label usage (27%) and insufficient evidence for usage (20%). Only 47% are willing to pay more for FC, with $437/g as the median amount. Fibrinogen concentrate is more expensive than cryo, even after adjusting for cryo wastage. To be economically competitive with cryo, FC must cost $414/g, or save on ICU length of stay, consistent with the survey's results.},

  abstract        = {Both plasma- and recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa)-based algorithms can be used to correct coagulopathy in preliver transplant patients with acute liver failure requiring intracranial pressure monitor (ICPM) placement. A decision model was created to compare the cost-effectiveness of these methods. A 70-kg patient could receive either 1 round of plasma followed by coagulation testing or 2 units of plasma and 40 μg/kg rFVIIa. Intracranial pressure monitor is placed without coagulation testing after rFVIIa administration. In the plasma algorithm, the probability of ICPM placement was estimated based on expected international normalized ratio (INR) after plasma administration. Risks of rFVIIa thrombosis and transfusion reactions were also included. The model was run for patients with INRs ranging from 2 to 6 with concomitant adjustments to model parameters. The model supported the initial use of rFVIIa for ICPM placement as a cost-effective treatment when INR ≥2 (with incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of at most US$7088.02). },

  abstract        = {Patients with abnormal placentation are hospitalized approximately 21 days prior to scheduled delivery due to risk of peri-partum bleeding. It is required to have at least one red blood cell (RBC) unit ready throughout hospitalization. This can be accomplished by performing a type and cross (T&C) every 72 h (traditional method) or providing phenotypically matched RBC units (alternative method). A Markov-based model was created to compare the cost-benefits between these two methods. A patient either undergoes the traditional or alternative method. If the patient already made an antibody and/or has rare phenotypes requiring frozen RBC unit at admission, then she can only enter the traditional method. All patients receive a T&C at the end of the 21st day in order to prepare RBC units for scheduled delivery. Model parameters are derived from literature and institutional experiences. Simulation was run for modelling of the 21-day hospitalization of each patient. The expected cost per RBC unit of the traditional method is significantly higher than the alternative method (876·59 vs. 608·32 USD, P-value <0·01). For each RBC unit, 4·85 h of technician working time is saved by the alternative method. However, to be cost-beneficial, the alternative method should be used only if the total cost of a RBC unit is <857·67 USD. Our model demonstrated that preparing phenotypically matched RBC units at admission is more cost-beneficial comparing to the traditional method of T&C every 72 h if the cost for the matched unit is <857·67 USD.},
